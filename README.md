KerentaNET
==========

This is an attempt to port my previous Kerenta Rails test application to .NET, after not touching code for a few years.

There's not much functionality or design here, mainly to test if I can still do a simple CRUD app in ASP.NET MVC.

You can view the app deployed at: http://kerenta.apphb.com/
